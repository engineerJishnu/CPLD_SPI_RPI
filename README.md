CPLD with Raspberry Pi

I have Guzunty Pi CPLD purchased from UK somewhere around 2014. As per Guzunty Pi wiki

The purpose of the Guzunty Pi input/output expander is to (1) Protect the delicate GPIO pins of the Raspberry Pi computer and
(2) Provide up to a net 25 additional input/output expansion lines.

the Guzunty is a Xilinx XC9500XL Complex Programmable Logic Device, or CPLD.

A CPLD is like several large breadboards laid out on your desk, full of every combination of logic devices you are ever going to need. It is waiting to be told what to do. It doesn't need a host of jumper wires like a breadboard would. It can be reprogrammed again and again (even at runtime), and it is small enough to fit on top of your Pi.

A CPLD program is often referred to as a ‘core’ to distinguish it from a regular computer program. Cores can do things thousands of times faster than an equivalent computer program.
